# VCOMP_23-24

All the work carried out on this repository was done as part of the final project for FEUP's Computer Vision course ([M.EEC034]).

The aim of this work was to detect the hand in the images and create a Bounding Box around it by segmenting it and comparing it with the ground truth provided in the dataset ([task1.m](task1.m)), then to identify a subset of the letters of the American sign language using the images available in the repository.
